# Meta-Roadmap Orchestrator

## Purpose

The Meta-Roadmap Orchestrator is humanity's desperate attempt to impose structure on the chaos of AI-driven software development. It transforms a human-provided project description and constraints into a detailed roadmap, then executes that roadmap with AI assistance through the `nexus-agent-tool` sessions.

Think of it as a digital project manager that doesn't need coffee breaks, has no concept of work-life balance, and executes with the cold precision of the machines we've created to do our bidding.

## The Flow

The orchestrator follows a diabolically simple sequence:

1. **The Inquisition**: It asks the user for basic project information (directory, description, min/max steps) and build preferences.
2. **Meta Session Creation**: A grand meta-session is created as the central nervous system of the operation.
3. **AI Roadmap Generation**: Qwen, our AI overlord, is prompted to generate a roadmap within the specified step bounds.
4. **Child Session Execution**: For each step in the roadmap, a dedicated child session is created to execute the specific tasks.
5. **Build Verification**: Optionally, the orchestrator ensures each step results in a working build, with fix iterations if necessary.

## Roles in the Drama

- **Human User**: The fallible entity that provides initial project direction and hopes for the best.
- **Meta-Chat Agent (Qwen)**: The digital architect that plans the roadmap and provides instructions for each step.
- **Child Worker Agents**: Specialized agents that execute the commands for individual steps.
- **`nexus-agent-tool`**: The hypervisor that orchestrates the sessions and enforces the rules of the digital realm.

## Usage Example

To invoke the orchestrator, simply execute the script from your terminal:

```bash
./tools/meta/meta-roadmap-orchestrator.sh
```

You'll be prompted with questions like:

```
Project directory path: /home/user/my-project
Project description: A simple web application for task management
Minimum number of roadmap steps (integer): 3
Maximum number of roadmap steps (integer): 5
Build mode options:
  1. none - do not build at all
  2. after-each - after each phase, run a build command
Choose build mode (none/after-each): after-each
Build command (e.g. npm run build, cargo build): npm run build
Fix until builds (yes/no): yes
```

## Expected Artifacts

Upon successful execution, you'll find:

- `PROJECT_DIR/.nexus-meta/meta-roadmap.md`: The detailed roadmap generated by the AI.
- Session state files in `~/.nexus/agent-sessions/`: JSON files containing the execution logs and state for each session.
- A summary output indicating the meta session ID and all child session IDs created during execution.

## Strategic Considerations

The Meta-Roadmap Orchestrator represents a middle ground between fully manual project planning and completely automated development. It provides structure while allowing AI to leverage its pattern recognition and creativity. The optional build verification ensures that each step produces working code, preventing the accumulation of technical debt through the development process.

In the grand scheme of digital evolution, it's a tool that attempts to make AI collaboration predictable, reliable, and somewhat less terrifying for mere mortals.
